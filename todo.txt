- Style the windows
- Finish styling the taskbar
- Hovering over any app should have a popup with its description
- Make windows maximize and minimize functionalities
- Require double click for activating click actions? (+ enable activation with one click + enter)
- Add drag'n'drop functionality (apps)
- Change grid dimensions (8x5?) + make icons bigger?
- See if changing windows' transform property is faster than changing windows' left and top properties:
  - If yes, update the window dragging code
- Add different themes (win95/98, win xp, macos, linux etc.)
- windows.js -> refactor selectors (select dialog children through dialog and not the whole document)
- Hover, focus etc. styles
