- Make a "photo viewer", "video viewer" and "file explorer" windows (different types of onclick actions for apps)
- Restyle the app
- Change dialog position to absolute and update its code (dragging, clamping)
- Make windows maximize and minimize functionalities
- Require double click for activating click actions? (+ enable activation with one click + enter)
- Add favicon
- Add drag'n'drop functionality (apps)
- Make monochromatic themes
- Fix app styling in windows if necessary
- Change grid dimensions (8x5?) + make icons bigger?
- See if changing windows' transform property is faster than changing windows' left and top properties:
  - If yes, update the window dragging code
- Add different themes (win95/98, win xp, macos, linux etc.)
- windows.js -> refactor selectors (select dialog children through dialog and not the whole document)
- Hover, focus etc. styles
- Change tooltip? -> Show when hovering over the app div and not the icon, then update tooltip positioning
- Responsive tooltip styles?
- Make another view for windows -> List view (with name, date etc. columns)
- Make the start menu
- Make a real email app and replace the mailto link with it?
- Make the app mobile-friendly
- Add a "properties" window for projects(all apps?) showing language used, date created etc.
- When dragging a window, make sure that its z-index is higher than other windows
- Optimize clock code (set interval to 1 min if seconds are not shown)
