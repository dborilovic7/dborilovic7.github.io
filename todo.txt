- Make windows that can be opened by clicking on folders:
  - Make a projects folder that opens a list of my projects
  - Make a blog folder that opens a list of my blog posts
- Make sure windows can't be dragged off the screen (clamp?)
- Finish styling the taskbar
- Hovering over any app should have a popup with its description
- Require double click for activating click actions? (+ enable activation with one click + enter)
- Add drag'n'drop functionality
- Change grid dimensions (8x5?) + make icons bigger?
- See if changing windows' transform property is faster than changing windows' left and top properties:
  - If yes, update the window dragging code
- Add different themes (win95/98, win xp, macos, linux etc.)
